# Redmine Projects-Queries Extension plugin

This plugin adds new filters and columns to projects queries.

It is only compatible with Redmine 4.1.0 and above.

This plugin is a fork from the [Better CrossProjects](https://github.com/jbbarth/redmine_better_crossprojects) plugin and you should continue to use this one if you are running Redmine 4.0.x or Redmine 3.


## Installation

Please apply general instructions for plugins [here](http://www.redmine.org/wiki/redmine/Plugins).

Requirements:

    ruby >= 2.7.0
    
Note that this plugin now depends on:
* **redmine_base_deface** which can be found [here](https://github.com/jbbarth/redmine_base_deface)

First download the source or clone the plugin and put it in the "plugins/" directory of your redmine instance. Note that this is crucial that the directory is named 'redmine_projects_queries_extension' !

Then execute:

    $ bundle install
    $ rake redmine:plugins

And finally restart your Redmine instance.

This plugin is only compatible with Redmine 4.1.0 and above.
Please feel free to report any bug you encounter.
